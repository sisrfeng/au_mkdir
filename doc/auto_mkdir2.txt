auto_mkdir2.vim: Automatically create directories
我小改了

==============================================================================
INTRODUCTION                                                     *auto_mkdir2*

Automatically create directories that don't exist yet when writing a file.

This allows you to do:

  vim ~/a/dir/tree/that/doesnt/exist/new-file.txt

and then just use |:w| (or |ZZ|, or |:up|, etc.) to create the directory tree.

This is basically the same as the "auto_mkdir" plugin, although it was
developed independently. This version has the option to confirm directory
creation and includes a bugfix for unicode directory names.

==============================================================================
FUNCTIONS                                              *auto_mkdir2_functions*

*auto_mkdir2#mkdir_p* (path, confirm)

        Create the directory [path],
        and ask for confirmation if [confirm] is not `0`.

*auto_mkdir2#autocmd* ()

        Convenience function for calling `auto_mkdir2#mkdir_p()` from an  autocmd.

==============================================================================
AUTOCMD                                                  *auto_mkdir2_autocmd*

By default this plugin will hook in to a |BufWritePre| |autocmd| to create
directories that don't exist yet when writing a file.

*g:auto_mkdir2_autocmd*
You can use the `g:auto_mkdir2_autocmd` to limit to a more specific set of  files,
for example:

        *.md            Only apply to Markdown files
        *.md,*.txt      Apply to Markdown and text files
        /some/dir/*     Only apply to files in /some/dir
        /dir/*,*.md     Only apply to files in /dir and all Markdown files

Use an empty string to not add any autocmd;
you can add your own autocmds  with:

        augroup auto_mkdir2
                au!
		au BufWritePre * call auto_mkdir2#autocmd()
        augroup end

Changing this setting at runtime doesn't do anything;
you'll have to set it at startup (i.e.
in your vimrc).

==============================================================================
COMMANDS                                                *auto_mkdir2_commands*

MkdirP[!] [directory]                                                *:MkdirP*

        Like `mkdir -p` from the shell:
        it will create all intermediate directories and will not show an error if the [directory] already exists and is a directory.

        The [directory] is |expand()|-ed.
        The parameter is optional and `%:h:p` is used if it is empty.

*g:auto_mkdir2_confirm*
        It will ask for confirmation
        if `g:auto_mkdir2_confirm` is set (default:
        1), and adding `!` will invert the value (so if this is set to `0` then it will ask for confirmation with `!`).
